Summary:

	It doesn't matter what I do for the rest of the week, the game is complete for this semester.  All there is left is to see if this game truly is fun, I'm not concerned about the forest levels, unless the tutorial levels are too few to show the potentials of this game.  That will depend on tester feedbacks.  I will only create the forest levels if the testers find the game fun, otherwise I'm just gonna have to think of new designs for next semester.  The rest is just finishing off all the major coding this semester which is very close to done.  
	I've removed all that is of Dimitry's work, he's now just a pebble at the bottom of my dark murky pool of memory...almost non existent.  Well, there is nothing left to report.
