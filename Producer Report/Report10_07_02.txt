			title
David Dionisio		Producer/Tech Director

Producer Report for Oct 07/02

Completed Last Week: (Sept. 30 - Oct. 6)

Dimitry: Completed models and all texturing.
	Menu source code 65% complete
	Wrote templatized link list for use w/ menu.

David: Defender Animation done, camera pathing and view control.  Script engine
       for the game integrated with camera functionality.  Added a few stuff in
       TDD.  Map loading done with entity loading.


This Week Goals: (Oct. 7 - Oct. 13)

Dimitry: Complete 2 character animation sets.
	 Complete 1st "Cloud" level.
         Continue integrating menus

David: More Ta-Ta animations (must complete them all), 
       Ta-Ta move around cloud level, HUD, push button.
       TDD due...don't really care.


Next Week Plans: (Oct. 14 - Oct. 20)

Dimitry: Finish menus
	 Complete last 2 animation sets.

David: Cloud level fully functional (select Ta-Ta, save, select level), complete Ta-Ta code.
       Possibly have all level object coding done...and maybe even start on enemies.
       Enemy animations.

Summary:

	Everything is going as planned, but we still can't afford to slack off.  Priority
has been put to having stuff happen in the game rather than all animations.  David might
have to push the due date for all animations.  David has decided to alternate on coding
one Ta-Ta and finish it's functionality.  David is still uncertain on how to code up the
AI, so TDD might still not be a waste of time...
