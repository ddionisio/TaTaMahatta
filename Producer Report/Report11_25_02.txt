Summary:

	The game is going smoothly, but I feel as if I really need
a break from working on the game.  Since the next professor is yet
to be known, I plan to finish the game next semester rather than
the end of this year.  Definitely need testers for this game, I don't
know whether to be happy with the current version or not.  I need
to hear from others.  If this game completely sucks...well then I'll
have more the reason to work on it next semester.
