Summary:

	As usual, things are going my way.  The game will
not be completed by the end of this semester.  However,
a full fledged shareware of this game will be released as
the final deliverable this semester.  This includes the
tutorial levels and the forest stages.  I have full confident
that this is acceptible.  As I've seen so far, too many games this
semester seems somewhat more lacking than this project.  The rest of the work will be completed during winter break and next semester.

	I plan to make another game next semester (as Digipen
requires that a multiplayer must be implemented for each project).
Well they'll get it alright.  As soon as this game is done, work
on the next project will start immediately.  Plans for the next
game starts during winter break.
